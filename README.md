Overall Steps to Run the Application Locally 🚀

STEP 1: Prerequisites ✅
Ensure you have the following installed:
Node.js: Download it from the official Node.js website.
npm (Node Package Manager): Comes bundled with Node.js.
Additionally, install Redux and React-Redux if not already present:
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux

STEP 2: Clone the Repository 🗂️
Use the following command in your terminal to clone the project repository:
git clone repository-url

STEP 3: Navigate to the Project Directory 📁
Change directory into the project folder:
cd project-name

STEP 4: Install Dependencies 📦
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies listed in package.json:
npm install

STEP 5: Create a .env File (If Required) 🔒
Set up your environment variables by creating a .env file in the root directory as needed for your application.

STEP 6: Configure Redux Store (If Needed) 🛠️
Ensure your Redux store is set up correctly. Check the following files:
store.js: Set up your Redux store.
dashboardSlice.js: Make sure your reducers and initial state are correctly defined.

STEP 7: Create the dashboardData.json File 📝
If you need initial state data for your dashboard, ensure the dashboardData.json file is in the correct directory. Here's a sample structure:
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Category 1",
      "widgets": []
    },
    {
      "name": "Category 2",
      "widgets": []
    }
  ]
}

STEP 8: Start the Development Server 🌐
Run the following command to start your application:
npm start
This will start the development server, and your application will typically open at http://localhost:3000. If it doesn’t open automatically, manually navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Troubleshooting Tips 🔧
If you encounter any issues during installation or running the app, check for error messages in the terminal or browser console for guidance.
Ensure paths to components and assets are correct, especially in import statements.
Check the version compatibility of packages if there are specific requirements.
Once you've followed these steps, you should be able to run your React application locally without issues! 😊
